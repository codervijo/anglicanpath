# Growth Log — anglicanpath.org

> **What this file is for:** an honest, append-only log of growth experiments
> on this site — what was tried, what was measured, what happened. The data
> source is GSC; this file narrates *why*. Future-you (or future-Claude)
> reads this when deciding what to try next, both on this site and on
> related sister sites.

## How to use this (workflow — re-read this when you forget)

**Add an entry whenever you do something growth-relevant.** That includes:
shipping new content, structural SEO changes (sitemap, schema, redirects,
internal linking), tech changes that affect crawl/indexing, marketing
pushes, backlink campaigns. *Not* every code commit — just things you'd
want to point at when GSC numbers move (or fail to).

**Each entry is a hypothesis you can be wrong about.** Commit to a
measurable KPI and an observation window before acting — otherwise "did
this work?" is just a feeling.

### Lifecycle of one entry

1. **Day of action** — append a new dated H2 with `Status: active`, the
   hypothesis, the KPI you'll watch, current baseline numbers, what you
   did, and the date to review (default: today + 28 days, matching GSC's
   reporting window).
2. **Review day** — pull current GSC numbers, compute delta vs baseline.
   Fill in **Result** and **Learning**. Set **Status** to `shipped` (worked,
   keep going), `failed` (didn't pay off, abandon), or extend the review
   another window if results are ambiguous.
3. **Never rewrite older entries.** Wrong hypotheses are the most valuable
   data — they tell you what NOT to repeat on the next site. Append, don't
   edit.

### Where to get the numbers

```bash
cd ~/work/projects/sites/portfolio && make run ARGS="gsc sync"
```

Then read the row for `anglicanpath.org`. Or pull from
https://search.google.com/search-console directly.

### Format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line hypothesis or action>
- **Status:** active | testing | shipped | failed | abandoned
- **Hypothesis:** <what you're betting will work — only on initial / new-bet entries>
- **KPI:** <what GSC metric / query / page>
- **Baseline:** <numbers at start>
- **Action:** <what was done; 1-2 lines>
- **Result:** <numbers after window; "TBD — review YYYY-MM-DD" until then>
- **Learning:** <why it worked / didn't; what to try next; "TBD" until reviewed>
```

## 2026-09-19 — Search demand for comparison questions such as "anglican vs catholic"…
- **Status:** active
- **Hypothesis:** Search demand for comparison questions such as "anglican vs catholic" is real and poorly served; a Reddit thread ranks first with keyword difficulty 1. Fair, clergy-reviewed explainer articles can therefore win those searches cheaply and bring in people actively considering Anglicanism. Guided paths and internal links move those readers to the parish finder, which cannot win through search on its own ("anglican church near me" goes to individual parish pages) but becomes the natural next step for readers. The finder's data and credibility come from the founder's existing ACNA and Continuing contacts, who verify parishes and link to the site from parish and diocese websites, and those links strengthen rankings. The 1928 and 1662 Daily Office brings people back every day and earns credibility with traditional Anglicans, turning one-time readers into regular visitors and email subscribers.
- **KPI:** any GSC traffic — clicks, impressions, indexed-page count
- **Baseline:** 0 clicks / 0 impressions (just deployed)
- **Action:** project scaffolded via `portfolio new bootstrap`; first deploy pending. After deploy: verify in GSC as `sc-domain:anglicanpath.org` and submit the sitemap.
- **Result:** TBD — review 2026-10-17
- **Learning:** TBD
